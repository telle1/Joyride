Create long distance rideshare app that allows a user to post a ride or search for rides to and from a destination. Users can request a ride and also message the driver. Web sockets will be used for messaging. Will also use Google Maps API and Twilio API to send the driver a message that he has received a request, and users if the request has been approved.
